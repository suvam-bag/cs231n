#Introduction
Solution codes for the assignments of the course, cs231n - Convolution Neural Networks for Visual Recognition offered at
Stanford University. This course offers hands on coding of state of the art deep learning concepts like Convolution Neural
Networks, Regional - Convolution Neural Networks, Recurrent Neural Networks as well as other machine learning concepts starting from Linear Classifers like k - Nearest Neighbour, Support Vector Machine, Softmax and Multilayer layer Neural Network etc. To clearly understand the breakdown of each module of this code, it is encouraged to visit the cs231n website from the link posted below and go through the notes and assignment descriptions. The code is broken down into modules and has immense capacity of modification as deep learning evolves more and more everyday. 

1. assignment1 - image classification, knn, svm, softmax, 2 layer neural net
2. assignment2 - fully connected nets, batch normalization, dropout, convolution nets
3. assignment3 - recurrent neural networks, image captioning, image gradients, deep dream

#Platform
1. Python
2. Jupyter Notebook
3. Cython

#Note
For downloading the CIFAR-10 dataset and other requirements for setting up the environment, please refer to the course's website.
